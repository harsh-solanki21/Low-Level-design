# Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit. The data in a class is hidden from
  other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.
- we can achieve encapsulation using `packages` and `access modifiers`.

- Encapsulation helps us to keep related fields and methods together, which makes our code cleaner and easy to read.
  It helps to decouple components of a system. These decoupled components can be developed, tested and debugged
  independently and concurrently. And, any changes in a particular component do not have any effect on other components.

<br />

**How to achieve encapsulation:**

1. Declare class variables as `private`.
2. Provide public `getter` and `setter` methods to provide controlled access to private fields.
