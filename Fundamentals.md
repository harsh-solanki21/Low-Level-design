### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
- In other words, the DRY principle encourages developers to write modular, reusable code and avoid duplicating the same
  functionality in multiple places.

<br />

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you might need them.
- By adding unnecessary features or over-engineering solutions, we incur additional complexity, which can slow down
  development, increase the likelihood of bugs, and make the codebase harder to maintain.

<br />

### KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid)

- It suggests that software should be designed to be easy to understand, modify, and extend, rather than complex and convoluted.

<br />

### Scalable code:

- Scalability can be judged on how many lines of code you need to modify to implement the new requirement code.

<br />

### Robust code:

- A code that can handle or process all the possible inputs without failing or generating error.
- Code that doesn't break: Means when you are writing a function that takes parameters. Your code never breaks whatever
  parameters are given.
  For example an integer multiplication function should even work (give guidance) when strings or floats or arrays are
  given as inputs.

<br />

### Modular code:

- Code that is logically broken up into functions and modules.

<br />

### Maintainable code:

- Your code is easy to read, understand, modify, and reuse by yourself and others.
